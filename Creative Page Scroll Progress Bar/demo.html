        <p>"Ahhh..."
The feeling of waking up was the worst.
After all, when you wake up to find your sister passionately dancing to a
samba rhythm while stepping all over your stomach or chest or head, other
than a special group of people, anyone would be unhappy.
April 10th, Monday.
Yesterday was the last day of Spring Break, so today is a school day.
While rubbing his bleary eyes, Shidou declared in a lowered voice:
"Ahh, Kotori. My cute little sister."
"Ohhhhh!?"
Only then did she finally notice that Shidou was awake. The little sister with
a foot still on Shidou's stomach—Kotori, turned her head while adjusting
her middle school uniform.
Her long hair, separated into two bunches, swayed, as she gazed at
Shidou through her round acorn-like eyes.
Incidentally, even though she was caught stepping on someone early in
the morning, she didn't seem to be secretly cursing, "Damn it!" or "I'm
caught!". If anything, it seemed that she was honestly happy that Shidou
had woken up.
Oh, and from Shidou's position, there was a stunning view of her
underpants.
It wasn't as if it was just showing a glimpse. Even shamelessness has its
limits.
"What is it? My cute brother!"
Kotori answered, without even a sign of moving her foot.
In case you were wondering, Shidou was not cute.
"Well, get off me. It's heavy."
Kotori gave an exaggerated nod and leapt from the bed.
Shidou's stomach was left with an impact like a body blow.
"Gfhu!"
"Ahahaha, gfhu! Ahahahaha!"
"..."
Shidou silently pulled the blanket over his head.
"Ahh! Hey~! Why are you sleeping again!"
Kotori raised her voice, slowly shaking Shidou.
"Just another ten minutes..."
"No way~! Wake up already!"
After sitting up and grimacing at the dizziness resulting from shaking his
still dazed head, Shidou opened his mouth with a groan.
"R-Run away..."
"Eh?"
"...Actually, I've been infected with the 'if I don't sleep for another 10
minutes I'll tickle my sister to death virus', a.k.a. the T-virus..."
"Wh-What!?"
Kotori was as surprised as someone who'd found a hidden message from
aliens.

"Run away... while I still can control myself..."
"B-But, what will you do!?"
"Don't worry about me... as long as you're safe..."
"No way! Brother!"
"Gaaaahh!"
"Kyaaaaaaaaaaa!"
Shidou blew the blanket away, excitedly moving his two hands and roaring,
as Kotori ran away with a dreadful scream.
"...Sigh"
Exhaling, he covered himself with the blanket again. Looking at the time, it
was still before six.
"What a time to wake someone at..."
Grumbling, he suddenly recalled something.
As his half asleep brain slowly woke up, last night's memories resurfaced.
Both of their parents had left on business trips yesterday.
Because of that Shidou was temporarily left in charge of the kitchen, and
so Shidou, who was bad at waking up, asked Kotori to help wake him.
"Ah..."
Troubled that he might've done something bad, he quickly got out of bed.
Holding down his bed hair and suppressing a yawn, Shidou plodded out of
the room.
At that moment, the small mirror hanging on the wall caught his eyes.
A boy whose forelocks were about to invade his vision, probably because
he hadn't had a haircut for a while, was casting a lame look at Shidou.
"..."
Together with his declining eyesight, his looks had also been slightly
degrading. Sighing, he descended the stairs and entered the living room.

"...Huh?"
A slightly different view than usual greeted him.
The wooden table that was in the middle of the living room was on its side,
as if it had become a barricade. Behind it, a head with twin-tails was
quivering slightly.
"..."
Silencing his footsteps, Shidou approached the side of the table.
Sure enough, Kotori was sitting there hugging her knees and trembling.
"Graaaaahh!"
"Kyaa! Kyaaaaaaa!"
As Shidou grabbed her by the shoulders, Kotori let out a despairing
scream as her limbs went limp.
"Calm down, calm down! I'm my usual self."
"Gyaaaa! Gyaa... ah? B-Brother?"
"Yep, that's right."
"You... You're not scary anymore?"
"It's alright now. I'm Kotowi's fwiend."
"Oh, ohhhhhh."
As Shidou talked to her in baby talk, Kotori's tightened face slowly relaxed.
It was as if she was a wild fox squirrel that had opened its heart.
"Sorry, sorry. I'll go make breakfast right away."
After letting go of Kotori's hand and standing up, Shidou put the table back
where it belonged and went into the kitchen.
Working at the large electronics company that the two of them built,
Shidou's parents were often away from the house at the same time.
At those times, it was always Shidou's responsibility to prepare food, so he
was already used to it. In fact, he was confident that he could use the
cooking tools better than his mother.

As Shidou was fetching some eggs from the fridge, he heard the sound of
the TV coming from behind him. It seems that Kotori had calmed down and
had turned on the TV.
Come to think of it, it seems Kotori has a daily routine to eat while checking
out horoscopes or fortune-telling corners.
Well, most of the fortune-telling corners usually comes at the end of the
main programs, and are obviously just speculations. After surfing through
all of the channels, Kotori started to watch what seemed to be a boring
news program.
"—Early this morning, in the suburbs of Tenguu City—"
"Huh?"
Overhearing the contents of the useless news program that usually could
only serve as BGM, Shidou raised an eyebrow.
The reason was simple. From the announcer's clear voice, he heard a
familiar street name.
"Nnn? It's pretty close by. Did something happen?"
Leaning over the counter, he narrowed his vision and stared at the TV.
On the screen, the image of a street that had been absurdly destroyed was
being displayed.
Buildings and roads had been reduced to mountains of rubble.
The devastation was like the impact of a meteorite, or maybe the scene of
an air raid.
Shidou scrunched up his brows, and releasing his held breath he said:
"Ahhhh... So it was a spacequake."
As if fed up, he shook his head.
A 'space earthquake' referred to the phenomenon of the shaking of a wide
area.
It was the generic term given to explosions, quakes, vanishings, and such
things that happen for unknown reasons at random times and places.

Like the whims of a large monster, destroying a street for the sake of it,
these were extremely unreasonable phenomena.
The first occurrence of such an event was around thirty years ago.
It happened right smack in the middle of Eurasia—the region that had
contained countries such as the Soviet Union, China, and Mongolia,
causing them to have disappeared in a single night.
For Shidou's generation, just looking at the pictures in the textbook was
unpleasant.
It was as if everything above ground had been scraped off, leaving
absolutely nothing behind.
Casualties numbered about 150 million. It was the largest and deadliest
catastrophe in human history.
In the six months that followed, similar incidents occurred on a smaller
scale all around the world.
Shidou couldn't remember the exact number, but it was around fifty.
On land, at the poles, in the ocean, even on small islands, such cases had
been confirmed.
Of course, Japan was not exempt.
Six months after the Eurasia Sky Disaster, the region from South Tokyo to
Kanagawa Prefecture had turned into a circle of scorched earth, as if an
eraser had been applied to it.
That's right—it includes the area that Shidou was living in today.
"But it suddenly stopped happening for a while, right? Why did it start
increasing in frequency again?"
"I wonder why...?"
At Shidou's question, Kotori, still staring at the TV, tilted her head.
After that South Kanto incident, spacequakes had not been detected for a
while.

However, five years ago, starting with a corner of the redeveloped Tenguu
City, these mysterious phenomena started popping up here and there
again.
Moreover, most of them happened in—Japan.
Of course humans had not been sitting around doing nothing for those
twenty-five years in between.
Starting thirty years ago with the areas that had finished redevelopment,
underground shelters had spread at an explosive rate.
Together with the fact that it had become possible to observe precursors to
spacequakes, a certified JSDF disaster response team had been put
together.
Their purpose was to travel to disaster areas and rebuild the destroyed
facilities and roads, but their work can only be described as magic.
After all, completely destroyed streets could, in an insanely short amount of
time, be restored to how they used to be.
Their work was classified as top secret and so no information was
available to the public, but when you see a collapsed building restored in a
single night, you can't help but feel like you just saw a magic trick.
However, even if the repair work could be done really fast, that doesn't
mean that there was little threat from the spacequakes.
"Doesn't it seem like the area around here has a lot of spacequakes?
Especially last year."
"...Hmm, seems that way, huh. Maybe it's a bit early..."
Kotori muttered, while leaning her upper body onto the arms of the sofa.
"Early? What is?"
"Nnn..., nophing."
This time it was Shidou who tilted his head.
It was not due to what Kotori said, but rather because the last half of it
seemed slightly muffled.
"..."

Silently, he circled around the counter, and walked towards the side of the
sofa which Kotori was leaning on.
Maybe Kotori had noticed it, but as Shidou came closer, she gradually
turned her face away.
"Kotori, turn this way for a moment."
"..."
*bonk*
"Guhh!"
Kotori held her head with her hands, and turned around with a jolt. A weird
noise came from her throat.
Seeing the item inside her mouth as expected, Shidou gave a short sigh,
"As I thought".
Even though it was right before breakfast, Kotori had her favorite candy,
Chupa Chups, in her mouth.
"Hey! Haven't I told you not to eat sweets before meals?"
"NNNnnn! NNNnnnnn!"
Taking away the candy and bringing out a stick, he found Kotori trying to
resist by pouting.
Shidou strained his face as he looked towards where he was about to hit,
since he really didn't want to hit someone with such cute features.
"...Jeez. You'd better properly eat your breakfast!"
In the end it was Shidou who folded. He rubbed Kotori's head, and
returned to the kitchen.
"Ohh! I love you, brother!"
Shidou suitably waved his hands and returned to his work.
"...Now that I think about it, today's the middle school opening ceremony,
right?"
"That's right~"

"Then you're coming back at lunch time... Kotori, any requests for lunch?"
After Kotori thought it through with a "Hmmmm", she shook her head, and
then suddenly stood up.
"Deluxe kids plate!"
It was a lunch item for kids offered at a nearby family restaurant.
Shidou straightened his body, and like that, gave an apologetic bow.
"That cannot be prepared in this store."
"Ehh~"
While sucking on a lollipop, Kotori replied with a dissatisfied voice.
Shidou gave a loud sigh and shrugged his shoulders.
"Whatever, nothing I can do about it, it's a special occasion so let's eat out
for lunch."
"OHHHH! Really!?"
"Yeah. Then, let's meet at the usual family restaurant after school."
Shidou said, and Kotori rubbed her hands together in excitement.
"No going back on your word! It's a promise! You have to be there even if
an earthquake starts or a fire erupts or a spacequake happens or the
family restaurant is occupied by terrorists!"
"No. If there's terrorists there we won't get to eat."
"You have to be there!"
"Fine, fine, I got it."
Hearing Shidou say that, Kotori vigorously raised her hands in the air with
a "Whoooo~!"
Shidou did not even consider that he might have been a bit too generous.
Well, today's special anyways.
From tonight onwards they would have to eat meals at home for a while,
but today's the opening ceremony for the two of them. This much luxury
should be fine.

Well, who knows whether a kids lunch that costs 780 yen really counts as
luxury.
"Nnnnn..."
Shidou stretched lightly, and opened the small window in the kitchen.
The sky had cleared up. It seems like today will be a good day.
